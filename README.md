<h1>Chris McCarthy</h1>
<h2>Full-stack software engineer @100Devs!</h2>
<p>I graduated college with an AS in Automotive Technology and a BS in Industrial Technology. It wasn't until 2022 that I realized my true passion was in tech, computers, and creating something  out of nothing with coding.</p>
<p>Thanks to Leon Noel and other free online curriculums such as FreeCodeCamp, I am now a full-stack software engineer proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.JS, and Python.</p>
<p>My goal is to create a more creative person's dream and to hopefully become a bit more imaginative myself along the way.</p>
